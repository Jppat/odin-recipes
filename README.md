#  The Odin Project | Project: Recipes
## Submission by John Patrick Panizales

This is a basic recipe website which is part of the Odin Project's curriculum for website development.

In this project, I applied what I learned about HTML, particularly using the following HMTL elements or concepts:

* headings
* Unordered and Ordered Lists
* img and its attributes
* html5 boiler plate
